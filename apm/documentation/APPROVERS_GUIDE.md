## Understanding the Approval Process

The APM system uses a multi-level approval workflow. Documents move through approvers in a specific order based on the workflow configuration.

### Key Concepts

- **Workflow**: A defined sequence of approvers for a document type
- **Approval Level**: Your position in the approval chain
- **Pending Approval**: Documents waiting for your review
- **Approval Trail**: History of all approvals and comments

Rejecting a document ends the approval workflow. Use this option only when the document cannot be approved.

- Activity is not aligned with objectives
- Other serious issues that cannot be corrected

### How to Reject

1. **Review Document Thoroughly**
   - Ensure rejection is justified
   - Consider if returning would be more appropriate
   
   ![Screenshot: Review Before Rejection](APM)

2. **Add Rejection Comments**
   - **Required**: Provide detailed reason for rejection
   - Explain why the document cannot be approved
   - Be clear and professional
   
   ![Screenshot: Rejection Comments](APM)

3. **Reject Document**
   - Click the **"Reject"** button
   - Confirm rejection in dialog
   - Document status changes to "Rejected"
   
   ![Screenshot: Reject Button](APM)

4. **Final Status**
   - Document cannot be resubmitted
   - Creator is notified
   - Document remains in system for record-keeping
   
   ![Screenshot: Rejected Status](APM)

### Important Notes

- **Rejection is Final**: Rejected documents cannot be resubmitted
- **Use Sparingly**: Only reject when absolutely necessary
- **Consider Return First**: If issues can be fixed, return instead of reject

## Approval Workflow

### Understanding Workflow Levels

Documents follow a multi-level approval process:

1. **Level 1**: First approver (usually supervisor or division head)
2. **Level 2**: Second approver (may be director or finance)
3. **Level 3+**: Additional approvers as configured
4. **Final Approval**: Last approver completes the workflow

![Screenshot: Workflow Levels](APM)

### Workflow Types

- **Sequential**: Approvers review one after another
- **Parallel**: Multiple approvers review simultaneously (if configured)
- **Conditional**: Different paths based on document attributes

### Your Position in Workflow

1. **Check Approval Order**
   - View approval trail to see your position
   - See who approved before you
   - See who will approve after you
   
   ![Screenshot: Approval Order](APM)

2. **Understand Your Role**
   - First approver: Initial review and validation
   - Middle approver: Secondary review and verification
   - Final approver: Final approval and authorization
